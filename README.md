## üìö Overview

Preprocessing is a critical step in NLP that transforms raw text into a clean, structured format. This toolkit covers essential preprocessing techniques to help you handle text data efficiently.

### üîß Key Features

- **Text Cleaning:** Remove unwanted characters, stopwords, and special symbols.
- **Tokenization:** Break down text into individual tokens (words, sentences).
- **Normalization:** Convert text to lowercase, expand contractions, and more.
- **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their base or root form.
- **Vectorization:** Convert text into numerical vectors using methods like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, and Word Embeddings.
- **Custom Preprocessing:** Create your own preprocessing pipelines tailored to specific tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods Included

- **1. Text Cleaning**
  - Removing punctuation, special characters, numbers.
  - Handling whitespace and line breaks.
  
- **2. Tokenization**
  - Word Tokenization
  - Sentence Tokenization

- **3. Normalization**
  - Lowercasing
  - Expanding contractions (e.g., `don't` to `do not`)
  - Removing stopwords

- **4. Stemming & Lemmatization**
  - Porter Stemmer
  - Snowball Stemmer
  - WordNet Lemmatizer

- **5. Vectorization**
  - Bag of Words
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
  - Word2Vec Embeddings
  - GloVe Embeddings

- **6. Custom Preprocessing Pipelines**
  - Combine multiple steps into a single, reusable pipeline.
